# Container-within-Container
  In this project, I have achieved containerization-within-container. Yes, you read it right, <b>Containerization-within-container</b>. Now you are wondering that isn't it           possible to do so ? So, Yes dear it is possible to do and here I will teach you the step-by-step procedure of how I build this interesting project. 
  
# Steps we will follow to accomplish this task are as follows-
1. First, we will create a Jenkins image on our own using Dockerfile.
2. When we launch this image, it should automatically starts Jenkins service in the container.
3. Create a job chain of job1, job2 and job3 using a build pipeline plugin in jenkins.  
4. <b>Job1</b> : Pull  the Github repo automatically when some developers push repo to Github.
